Current best agent: Beats MediumAI from the game after minimal training in baseset and steelsplitter-only. ExpertAI and above is memory intensive.
Easy to extend, more features and benchmarking coming soon

TO-DO:
*Self-Play
*Better annotation of state/action space
*Different statespace representations
*Benchmarks and trained models
*Curiosity module
*More unit game modes
